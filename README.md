Problem Statement:

Our goal is to create a program / website application which randomly generates 8 groups with 4 teams each.
For e.g., this year’s group stage looks like this:

Rules & Instructions:

● Use the list of teams given on Page 1.
● Group names will be “Group A”, “Group B”, “Group C” and so on.
● A group cannot have more than one team from the same country.
● The teams marked in red are domestic league champions. The first team of every group must be a domestic league champion.
● The program should be able to generate a fresh new list each time it is run.
● The program should output a list of teams under each group title.
● Added points for showing club logos in output.
● You are free to use any programming language / stack. Use of database is up to you.
● Create and send a ZIP file of your project, with instructions to execute, if any.
● Every candidate who completes the task has to upload in their personal repo and share the URL with us instead of sending a zip.
● Candidates will be having 2 days time to complete the assignment.
● If we find that code is shared between candidates both candidates will be disqualified from future rounds.
All the best!
